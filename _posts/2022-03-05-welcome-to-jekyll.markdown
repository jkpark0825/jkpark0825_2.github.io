I am Ph.D student advised by <a href="https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/faculty//">Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee.</a>
I am interested in deep learning and computer vision, exploring human 3D reconstruction and image restoration, combining high-level and low-level tasks in my recent research.
Currently, I am focused on creating an image restoration dataset that aligns with general images and developing a model to predict visually pleasing results.
