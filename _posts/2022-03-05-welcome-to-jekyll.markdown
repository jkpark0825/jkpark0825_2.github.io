I am Ph.D student advised by <a href="https://cv.snu.ac.kr/index.php/faculty//">Prof. Kyoung Mu Lee.</a>
I am interested in deep learning and computer vision, exploring human 3D reconstruction and image restoration, combining high-level and low-level tasks in my recent research.
Currently, I am focused on creating an image restoration dataset that aligns with general images and developing a model to predict visually pleasing results.


`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
